# 📸 SQL Analytics Project for Social Media

This project is inspired by [sajangupta1234's SQL Advanced Project for Social Media](https://github.com/sajangupta1234/SQL-Advanced-Project-for-Social-Media/tree/main), with the addition of custom solutions and query styles based on my own exploration and learning process.

The project uses a simulated **Instagram Clone (IG Clone)** dataset to perform **SQL Analytics** that help uncover user behavior, content patterns, and bot detection mechanisms in a social media platform.
